## HERE IS A COLLECTION OF GENERATIVE SKETCHES CREATED STARTING FROM 10PRINT LOGARITHM

_I created this sketches with p5.js starting from 10prit logarithm_

_I mantained Black and White grad and a squared composition for all the sketches to mantain a kind of link between them_

## 1. LINE CLIMAX

[_GO CHECK IT OUT!_](https://editor.p5js.org/MaxMax/full/N3nxasS3H)

_Squares are automatically genereted following the maze logarithm; by clicking the mouse you are able to adjust the size of the lines in ascending order, giving you the possibility to create always different compositions_

## 2. ELEKTRO MAZE

[_GO CHECK IT OUT!_ ](https://editor.p5js.org/MaxMax/full/32hhagk-w)


_Starting from 'Line climax' I created this version in which the lines are just created to connect the squares vertically, creating a kind of pixel world maze, in this sketch there is not the possibility of adjust parameters with external iteractions but it will automatically change colors while generating_

## 3. MIND MAZE

[_GO CHECK IT OUT!_](https://editor.p5js.org/MaxMax/full/wQgwV6MlT)

_This version has a more classical and minimal maze look, differetly to the others it is self generating from left to right insthad of cascade._
